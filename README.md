# üì± NoSQL Social Network API

This is a RESTful API for a social network application built using **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. It enables users to create accounts, post thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friends list ‚Äî all through a NoSQL database.

This API demonstrates full CRUD operations for users and thoughts, supports nested subdocuments for reactions, and includes virtual properties for total friends and reaction counts. It is tested using **Insomnia** and is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data.
